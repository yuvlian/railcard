## Railcard

Railcard is a Honkai: Star Rail character showcase cards maker. It uses Python (v3.12) and powered by [mihomo](https://github.com/KT-Yeh/mihomo). Yes it supports custom images. Yes it indicates relic rarity with the background color.

To get started, run terminal as admin and type these in:

- `git clone https://github.com/yuvlian/railcard.git`
- `cd railcard`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt `
- `python main.py`

You can also get the [prebuilt](https://github.com/yuvlian/railcard/releases/download/Release/railcard.7z) instead if you don't want to do any of the steps above.

(This one is generated with an older version, it is here to showcase the handling of no LC and no relics.)
